  ⚡ Fun fact: 
   💫 I was a Test Operations Engineer on the NASA/USGS LandSat9 Space Satellite!
    My name, (along with every Landsat 9 team members name), is engraved on a plaque that was
    placed on the NASA/USGS Landsat 9 Satellite upon completion, prior to its launch into space
    on September 27th, 2021.
    Landsat 9 is currently in operation in and around earth’s Low Earth Orbit (LEO), so my name
    is currently floating in space!✨
